I am bioinformatician and did my PhD at Max Planck Insitute for Chemical Ecology, Jena. Currently I am postdoc in UC Davis, working on climate adaptation in California's mountain jewelflowers. I am mostly interested in natural history driven evolutionary questions, agnostic of any particular species. I like to observe the nature, and let it lead to questions which I think about testing them using whatever data I can get my hands on. I also love to capture the nature at the same time, especially birds, in my photo album.
